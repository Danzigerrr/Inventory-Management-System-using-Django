### System Design Document: Inventory and Stock Management App

---

#### 1. **Introduction**

This document outlines the design of a web-based Inventory and Stock Management System, which includes hardware and software requirements necessary to support the application. This system is designed to manage inventory, sales, and user interactions with the added functionality of different access levels for users.

---

#### 2. **System Overview**

The Inventory and Stock Management App is a Django-based web application that allows users to manage inventory, view sales reports, and handle user registrations and logins. The system is designed with different levels of access, including administrative (superuser) privileges.

        - `inventory_report.html`: Template for showing detailed inventory reports.

- **Users**: Manages user authentication and profiles.
    - **Models**:
        - `User`: Manages user credentials and roles.
        - `Profile`: Contains additional user profile information.
    - **Views**:
        - **Login**: Handles user login functionality.
        - **Register**: Manages user registration.
        - **Profile**: Allows users to view their profiles.
    - **Templates**:
        - `login.html`: Form for user login.
        - `register.html`: Form for new user registration.
        - `profile.html`: Page for viewing user profiles.

- **Static Files**: CSS, JS, and image files used for styling and functionality.
**4.3. Database Schema**

- **Product**: Stores product details.
- **InventoryTransaction**: Tracks inventory changes (purchases, adjustments).
- **Sales**: Records sales transactions.
- **User**: Manages user credentials and roles.

#### 5. **Deployment Strategy**

**5.1. Docker Configuration**

- **Dockerfile**: Contains the instructions to build the application container.
- **docker-compose.yml**: Manages multi-container applications including the web server and database.

**5.2. Deployment Steps**

1. **Build Docker Image**:
   ```bash
   docker build -t inventory-app .
   ```
2. **Run Docker Containers**:
   ```bash
   docker-compose up
   ```

**5.3. Server Configuration**

- Configure the server with Nginx or Apache to serve the Django application.
- Set up the database (PostgreSQL/MySQL) and configure Django settings accordingly.

---

#### 6. **Security Considerations**

- **Authentication**: Use Djangoâ€™s built-in authentication for user management.
- **Authorization**: Ensure proper role-based access controls for superuser and regular users.
- **Data Protection**: Use HTTPS for secure data transmission.

---

#### 7. **Backup and Recovery**

- **Database Backup**: Regular backups of the database should be scheduled.
- **Application Backup**: Regular backups of the application files and Docker configurations.

---

#### 8. **Maintenance and Support**

- **Updates**: Regular updates to Django and other dependencies.
- **Monitoring**: Use monitoring tools to track application performance and errors.
